What does Foucault identify as a problem with modern discourse about sex?
\end{block}
\begin{description}
\item[A\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] modernity is too
  body-focused (instead of mind-focused) in its sexuality
\item[B\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] we talk about sexual desire too much
  (the endless mill of speech)
\item[C\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] we don't talk about sex
  enough (repressed sexual desire must be articulated)
\item[D\hspace{.2in}$\blacktriangleright$] men want sex, women want
  conversation (gender imbalance with respect to verbal and sexual
  intimacy)
